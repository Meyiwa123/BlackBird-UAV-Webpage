		Blackbird UAV, is a student run organization that runs almost exclusively through the generous
		support of our sponsors. We simply would not fly without these contributions. Your contributions
		are helping develop the future of the Canadian space industry and the development of exciting
		medical research. This fosters a creative, inventive environment where students are able to make
		and improve on their mistakes. Beyond that, your organization becomes part of our team. With
		ample opportunities to visit, frequent featuring on our social media platforms, and flying your
		logo on a drone, we make sure to further your brand.
